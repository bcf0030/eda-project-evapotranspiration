    "# Introduction to the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding **evapotranspiration (ET)** is central to many environmental and water-resources applications. ET represents the combined process through which water leaves the land surface and enters the atmosphere in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaporation**: liquid water turning into vapor from soil or wet surfaces  \n",
    "- **Transpiration**: water released by plants during physiological processes  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because ET links the **water cycle**, **climate**, and **ecosystem functioning**, it is one of the most important variables for understanding how landscapes respond to environmental changes. ET controls how much water remains available in the soil, how vegetation uses water, and how energy is exchanged between the land surface and the atmosphere. Even small changes in ET can affect drought intensity, agricultural productivity, and regional water budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Study ET in a Semi-Arid Grassland?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the **US-SRG site (Santa Rita Grassland, Arizona)**, a semi-arid grassland ecosystem. These environments are strongly shaped by:\n",
    "- limited water availability  \n",
    "- high temperatures  \n",
    "- strong seasonality driven by monsoon rainfall  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because water is often the main limiting factor for vegetation growth, semi-arid ecosystems show a very **sensitive and dynamic relationship** between ET and climate. Studying ET here helps us understand how ecosystems cope with water scarcity and how environmental drivers (radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation) shape ET patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This site was selected because it provides:\n",
    "- continuous, high-quality environmental observations  \n",
    "- a water-limited climate where ET responses are ecologically meaningful   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses two complementary datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. AmeriFlux – Environmental and Meteorological Data\n",
    "AmeriFlux is a long-term network of ecological research towers across North America. It provides high-frequency ground measurements of variables that directly influence ET, including:\n",
    "- precipitation  \n",
    "- air temperature  \n",
    "- solar radiation  \n",
    "- vapor pressure deficit (VPD)  \n",
    "- soil moisture and soil temperature   \n",
    "- wind speed  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, all environmental drivers come from the **US-SRG AmeriFlux site**.  \n",
    "Reference: Russell Scott (2025). AmeriFlux FLUXNET-1F US-SRG Santa Rita Grassland, Ver. 5-7, AmeriFlux AMP, (Dataset). https://doi.org/10.17190/AMF/2204877\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. OpenET – Satellite-Based Evapotranspiration\n",
    "ET itself is obtained from **OpenET**, a platform that uses satellite data and surface energy-balance modeling to generate reliable monthly and daily ET estimates across the Western United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "While AmeriFlux provides *local, tower-measured environmental conditions*, OpenET provides **spatially consistent ET estimates**, making it ideal for examining monthly ET dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference: OpenET (2021). OpenET Monthly Evapotranspiration Dataset. OpenET Data Explorer. Retrieved from https://openetdata.org\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Window Alignment Between AmeriFlux and OpenET\n",
    "\n",
    "The two datasets used in this project differ in their temporal coverage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AmeriFlux (environmental drivers)**: monthly data available from 2008 to 2024 for the US-SRG site.  \n",
    "- **OpenET (evapotranspiration)**: monthly ET estimates available from 2020 to mid-2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the analysis depends on comparing evapotranspiration (ET) with climate variables from AmeriFlux, both datasets must cover **exactly the same date range**. This ensures that each monthly ET value from OpenET can be aligned with the corresponding environmental conditions measured in AmeriFlux.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This first notebook focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** of both datasets (AmeriFlux and OpenET). Specifically, it will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- load the raw environmental and ET datasets  \n",
    "- inspect structure, variable names, and time coverage  \n",
    "- convert timestamps and ensure alignment across datasets  \n",
    "- handle missing or inconsistent values  \n",
    "- prepare a clean, analysis-ready dataset for later exploration  \n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing step ensures that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and suitable for analyzing how climatic conditions influence ET in a water-limited semi-arid grassland ecosystem.\n",
    "\n"
